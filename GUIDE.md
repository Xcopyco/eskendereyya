## Conventions 

- When Arabic is mentioned without any preceding qualifier in this guide, it refers to all varieties of Arabic whether the standard or the regional languages/dialects.

- The headings in the [Standard Letters](#standard_letters) subsection is structured like this; the number enclosed within parentheses refers to the position in the standard alphabetical order in MSA then followed by the Arabic letter and finally the Eskéndereyya letter and separated by the pipe «|» character.

- For the [Extended Alphabet](#extended_alphabet), the same rule above applies but instead of the numerical alphabetical order enclosed by parentheses, it's alphabetical.

## General rules

- **Stress:**

In most cases, stress for multi-syllable words in Arabic is on the **penultimate** syllable. However, this can be overridden when the need arises with these acute accent letters «á», «í», «ú» and less often by these «é», «ó».

- **Tonality:**
 
In general, tonality in Arabic is **soft**. Meaning, the pronunciation of Arabic words will often follow the pattern of these English words; «fan», «man», «ban», «ran» but not those «fun», «done», «bun», «run» unless otherwise indicated by the [bass vowels](#bass_vowels). 

This rule is **very important** if you'd like to sound more like a native and less like a foreigner. 

- **Pausa-only pronunciation:**

Formal rules of pronunciation in MSA dictate the use of grammatical case vowel endings on words but these are seldom observed in everyday speech even in formal context. So, if you're not going to dabble into MSA or [Classical Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Arabic) poetry or liturgy, you should be fine with [pausa-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausa) pronunciation rules. 

However, a future release that supports these use cases is under consideration and will be developed in a way that won't compromise the integrity of the current system in place and how words are represented. 

- **Gemination:** 

Double the consonant to give stress for the sound being reproduced. 

## Alphabet

### <span id="vowels">Vowels</span>

- **Weak (Short)**

These vowels are usually represented by [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritics) like «Fatħa», «Kasra», «Đamma» in Arabic, while in Eskéndereyya; «a», «e» and «o» are used which are identical to those same letters in [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language#Segmental_phonology). 

**Examples**

|English|Eskéndereyya|
|-------|-----------|
| Far   | far |
| Fin   | fen |
| For   | for |

- **Strong (Long)** 

While these vowels are represented by the letters «ا», «و», «ي» in Arabic, in Eskéndereyya they are **often but not always** represented by those corresponding letters «a», «u», «i». Since these vowels, as you might guessed it, are strong, they overpower other weak vowels in the same multi-syllable word, and consequently shift the stress on their syllable, and getting **often** as a result the acute accent «á», «ú», «í».

**Examples**

|English|Eskéndereyya|

| Faraway| fárawey |
| Fear   | fir |
| Fool   | ful |

This is where the principle of intuitiveness in Eskéndereyya shines through and surpasses other existing systems and standards. Instead of opting for just **one** letter to represent that phoneme or letter in Arabic, six were invented to cover all the cases of orthography.

I know that this may sound unintuitive and impractical on the face of it but when examined closely, you'd appreciate the intuitiveness and how the fall-backs placed in the system help with learning.

As you may have noticed in the vowels section, there are five vowels in Eskéndereyya namely «a», «e», «i», «o», «u». Instead of dedicating an independent letter for that sound followed by the appropriate vowel as usual, the roles have been reversed with these vowels getting in the driver seat and pushing the sound itself to the back seat.

This is one member of the *notorious* group of [emphatic consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphatic_consonant) in Arabic. You can simulate the sound by giving your «s» in English some boost or *bass* from your throat to accompany the usual sound. Otherwise, just go with sound suggested by the fall-back or the visual cue provided by the letter itself.

#### ([18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin#Arabic_.CA.BFAyn)) | ع | ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ  ў 

This follows the same rules for the first letter in the Arabic alphabet «[أ ء](#1)» concerning the sound but instead of the umlaut or diaeresis, you would use the breve mark on the vowels and Sokún like this «ă», «ĕ», «ĭ», «ŏ», «ŭ» and «ў», respectively.

Regarding the pronunciation and since this sound is not featured in English and it's reportedly one of the most difficult sounds to simulate even from speakers of Eastern languages, we will run a small experiment here that I hope it helps Arabic learners reproduce or perfect that sound. 

The experiment goes like this and I mean no offense to German speakers but this is just the solution that I came up with to approach this problem, you start with the normal pronunciation of the word «[Ja](https://translate.google.com/#de/en/ja)» in German and then gradually go extreme with the way you open your mouth and pronounce the word and in the end when you can barely pronounce the word or any word for that matter, you should get your «ăyn/ĕên ع» right.

This is like the «a» sound you make in «apple» but on steroids. You just have to go deeper in your throat to make the sound. If this is untenable, you might find solace temporarily in going with the fall-back picked by Eskéndereyya i.e. the sound «k».

### <span id="extended_alphabet">Extended Alphabet</span>

#### ([a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_%28Persian_letter%29)) | چ | j 

This letter and associated sound is featured in Egyptian Arabic to represent the «[j](#j)» sound because the letter «ج» in MSA is already taken for the «g» sound in Egyptian Arabic. 

#### ([b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_%28Persian_letter%29)) | پ | p 

Contrary to the wide held belief, the sound «p» does exist in Arabic and native Arabic speakers do differentiate between the «b» and «p» sounds even if they are not aware of that but the problem is that the letter «[ب](#b)» is overloaded and represents both sounds and that's why this borrowed letter «پ» is good to clear this confusion for new and foreign words. 

**Examples:**

|MSA|Eskéndereyya|

| Vendetta | vendeta |

#### ([d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaf#Gaf_with_line)) | گ | g 

The «g» sound in Eskéndereyya doesn't exist natively in MSA and therefore this letter has been borrowed from Farsi to compensate for the lack of the sound. Please note that in Egyptian Arabic the letter «[ج](#j)» is reserved for the sound «g» while it isn't the case in MSA or other languages/dialects varieties like Levantine and Tunisian Arabic, hence the new letter.

**Examples:**

### ڟ | ẑ 

This letter «ڟ» is not standard even in the extended alphabet but it's useful to convey the common and non-standard pronunciation for the letter «[ظ](#%C5%BE) ž» in regional languages and dialects like Egyptian and Levantine Arabic. 

It's pronounced like a «[z](#%C5%BE)» but with air boost, the same like «ž» is the air-boosted version of «[ż](#%C5%BC)».

## Extended Vowels

### <span id="bass_vowels">Bass Vowels</span> | ã õ ȃ

Like I said before that tonality in Arabic is most of the time soft and tender esp. for vowels. Think «cat», «hat», «rat», «bat» and **not** «cut», «hut», «rut», «butt». I can't **overemphasize** that enough. However, in some cases the tone gets harsher and more constricted esp. in regional languages/dialects. 

For example, it's «mat مات» like in the English word «mat» in both MSA and Egyptian Arabic but in Syrian Arabic, it'd be pronounced more like «mȃt» as in the English word «mutt» with the «a» sound a bit constricted and harsh. 

That's why those letter were added to convey these sounds more clearly and neatly. For extra "bass" and boost of the sounds though, the tilde letters such as «ã» and «õ» are to be used like in some Islamic terms like «ällã الله» and «qoräãn قُرْآن» 

To recap, the vowels in Arabic go from soft with no diacritic to mildly constricted with an inverted breve mark like «ȃ» to highly constricted with a tilde mark like «ã». 

Please note that empathic consonants in Arabic require a more constricted sound for proper pronunciation and because of this built-in characteristic, it becomes redundant and unnecessary to supply these details with diacritics on successive vowels. 

### Double Vowels | ô ê 

These «ô» and «ê» should not be mistaken for tonality modulation letters, they're just aliases for «oo» and «ee», respectively. They represent holding the sound for double the time unit dedicated for the single letter and they're featured extensively in regional dialects/languages like Egyptian and Syrian Arabic. 

They're optional to use but recommended nevertheless due to the offered benefits of compactness and neatness.

This is the MSA verse of the song [Ojos Así](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BzkbSq7pww) by Shakira:

أرجوك ربي لبي ندائي
